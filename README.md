# threejs-bowling
This is a small project created for the Graphic Computing course [BarbosaLuis](https://github.com/BarbosaLuis) and I took on the first semester of 2016 at [Universidade Federal de São Carlos](http://www2.ufscar.br/).

The idea was to build a game or animation using WebGL, so we did some research and found out about threeJS, which we used to make a bowling game.

## The game
This game is a simple bowling game with some basic animations and terrible collision (ops).

The project had some requirements. Some of them were:
- Make at least 3 different objects
- Make 3 custom animations
- Make at least 2 objects interact with each other
- Use Bézier Curve on a geometry or animation
- Use GLSL shaders for at least 1 texture
- Have some kind of user control

## Playing
The game can be played [here](http://gruutak.github.io/threejs-bowling/).
Constrols include moving the mouse horizontally or using left and right keys to position the ball and pression space bar or left mouse button to throw the ball.
